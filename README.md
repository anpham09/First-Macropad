## 📝 Description

This macropad features:
- 4 mechanical push buttons for user input  
- 2 SK6812 addressable RGB LEDs for lighting effects  
- A Seeed Studio XIAO microcontroller as the brain of the device  
- Custom PCB layout designed in KiCad  
- Hand-solderable design with through-hole switches and components  

This is perfect as a beginner-friendly PCB project that involves basic routing, digital inputs, and RGB control!
